    "In this capstone exercise, you'll be tasked with constructing a pipeline that drives a visualization, plotting problems in a bar chart.\n",

    "Here are a few tips to help get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin with the **correlated_answers** collection. This collection contains all student submissions in a much more succint format than other collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that each document in **correlated_answers** is one student's performance in an entire course. The problems attempted are accessible at the ``submissions`` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``submissions`` is an array of the problems. It might be helpful to **$unwind** this array to create a new document for every problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll need to **$group** similar problems together! There's other information that you'll need to preserve in the initial grouping phase.\n",
